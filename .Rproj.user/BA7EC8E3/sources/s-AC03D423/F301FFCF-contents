This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
source("~/GitHub/Course_Project_2/SourceCode.R")
NEI  <- nei()
str(NEI)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
```{r}
  x <-NEI %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise (sum(Emissions)/1000000)
  colnames(x) <- c("year", "total_PM2.5" )
 
  
  xx  <- barplot(x$total_PM2.5, ylab = "Total PM2.5", ylim = c(0, 10), names.arg = x$year, col="steelblue")
  text(xx, x$total_PM2.5 + 1, labels = as.character(round(x$total_PM2.5,2)))
  lines(xx, x$total_PM2.5, lwd = 2,col="red",lty=1)
  mtext(2,text="(in Millions)",line=2)
  title(main="Total Emissions PM2.5 Tons in millions per year")
```

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
