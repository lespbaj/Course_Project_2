This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
source("~/GitHub/Course_Project_2/SourceCode.R")
NEI  <- nei()
str(NEI)
```

1.  **Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.**

    the answer is yes as we can evidence in the following graph. This graph is in millions Tons for a better understanding:

```{r}
  x <-NEI %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise (sum(Emissions)/1000000)
  colnames(x) <- c("year", "total_PM2.5" )
 
  with( x, {
    barplot(total_PM2.5, ylab = "Total PM2.5", ylim = c(0, 10), names.arg = year, col="steelblue")
    text(year, total_PM2.5 + 1, labels = as.character(round(total_PM2.5,2)))
    lines(total_PM2.5,  lwd = 2,col="red",lty=1)
    mtext(2,text="(in Millions)",line=2)
    
})
title(main="Total Emissions PM2.5 Tons in millions per year", outer = T)
```

2.  **Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (**\color{red}{\verb|fips == "24510"|}**fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.**

```{r}
  x  <- NEI %>% filter(fips == "24510")  %>%   group_by(year)  %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
  colnames(x) <- c("year", "total_PM2.5" )
```

We could say that, in general, it has decreased. we only have an exception in 2005 but as we can see the statistical trend is negative.

```{r}
  x  <- NEI %>% filter(fips == "24510")  %>%   group_by(year)  %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
  colnames(x) <- c("year", "total_PM2.5" )
  
  par (mfcol = c(1,2), mar=c(1,1,1,1), oma = c(0,0,2,0))
  with(x ,{
            barplot(x$total_PM2.5, ylab = "Total PM2.5",xlab = "years", ylim = c(0, 5000), names.arg = x$year, col="steelblue")
            text(year, total_PM2.5 + 100, labels = as.character(round(x$total_PM2.5)))
            lines( total_PM2.5, lwd = 2,col="red",lty=1)
            mtext(2,text="Total",line=2, outer= TRUE)
            
            }
        )
  with(x ,{
            plot ( year,  total_PM2.5 , col = "red", pch = 3, ylim= c(0,5000), ylab = "Total PM2.5", xlab = "years")
            lo <- lm(total_PM2.5~year)
            abline(lo, col="green", lty ="dotdash")
            text (x= 2004, 2800, "linear regession", srt = -23, col = "green")
            title(main="Total PM2.5 Tons per year", outer = T)
          }
      )
  
```

3.  **Of the four types of sources indicated by the** \color{red}{\verb|type|}**type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999--2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999--2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.**

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
x <- NEI  %>% filter(fips == "24510")  %>%  group_by(across(c(year, type))) %>%  summarise (sum(Emissions))
colnames(x) <- c("year", "type", "Emissions")

```

```{r}
x <- NEI  %>% filter(fips == "24510")  %>%  group_by(across(c(year, type))) %>%  summarise (sum(Emissions))
colnames(x) <- c("year", "type", "Emissions")
g <-ggplot(x)
g + geom_point (aes(x$year, x$Emissions, color=x$type), lwd = 4 ) +
  geom_line (aes(x$year, x$Emissions, color=x$type)   )

```

4.  **Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999--2008?**

```{r}
x <- inner_join(NEI, SCC, by = c("SCC" = "SCC"))
y  <-  x %>% filter (grepl('[Cc]oal', x$SCC.Level.Three)) %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(sum(Emissions))
```

```{r}
g  <-  ggplot(y)
g + geom_col(aes(y$year, y$`sum(Emissions)`),col="steelblue") + geom_line(aes(y$year, y$`sum(Emissions)`), lwd = 2, col = "green") + geom_point(aes(y$year, y$`sum(Emissions)`), lwd = 4 , col = "red") + labs( x= "years", y = "Emissions uin Tons") + ggtitle( "Coal Emissions in Tons")
